# Project Timber
Timbr is a web service/application that turns an arbitrary web page into structure JSON data, it provides a friendly interface allow users **without programming experiences** to let our application know which part of data you want with a few clicks.

# Motiviation/ Who can use
There two challenges toward web crawler/scrapers:
1. No **Unique** web crawler/scrapers for every websites due to different DOM structure and design of different websites.
2. Writing Web Crawler/scrapers need programming experience/skills.

These two reasons are main reasons Project Timbr come out! Ideally, we want to create a **Unique** web application (combining crawlering and scraping tasks) for every websites. We provide a friendly interface letting every people (with none or few programming skills) click their mouse few times and our application can know how to deal with all the tasks!
